  "description": "Abuja, Nigeria's purpose-built capital, stands as a symbol of unity and modernity in the heart of the nation. Established in the 1980s, this well-planned city is renowned for its striking architecture, expansive green spaces, and the iconic granite monoliths like Aso Rock and Zuma Rock that punctuate its landscape. It offers a contrasting experience to Nigeria's older cities, focusing on contemporary urban development and national pride.\n\nCulturally, Abuja is a vibrant mosaic, reflecting the rich diversity of Nigeria's over 250 ethnic groups. While it doesn't boast ancient ruins, its cultural tapestry is woven through bustling markets like the Wuse Market, the Abuja Arts and Crafts Village where local artisans display their work, and a growing culinary scene that offers everything from traditional Nigerian dishes to international cuisine. Religious landmarks such as the majestic Nigerian National Mosque and the impressive National Christian Centre highlight the city's commitment to religious tolerance.\n\nKey attractions for visitors include the expansive Millennium Park, perfect for relaxation; the Jabi Lake Mall, offering retail therapy and lakeside recreation; and a visit to the Aso Rock Presidential Villa for a glimpse of the seat of power. The National Museum provides insights into Nigeria's history and ethnographic heritage. For travel, ride-sharing apps are convenient, and the dry season (November to February) offers the most pleasant weather. Abuja provides a unique window into Nigeria's aspirational future, blending urban sophistication with natural beauty and a welcoming, diverse populace.",
