This city is renowned for its profound cultural heritage and artistic prowess, having been the capital of one of West Africa's most powerful pre-colonial empires. Its legacy is etched in exquisite bronze castings, intricate ivory carvings, and a rich oral tradition that continues to thrive.

The historic Igun Street, designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, is a must-see, where descendants of ancient guilds continue the age-old craft of bronze casting, hammering and molding metal into stunning works of art. Beyond its historical sites, Benin City pulsates with bustling local markets, offering a vibrant array of local produce, crafts, and a chance to savor authentic Edo cuisine. The city's enduring cultural festivals, such as the grand Igue Festival, further immerse visitors in its unique customs and ceremonies, showcasing the community's deep connection to ancestral roots.
