  "description": "Quepos, a vibrant coastal town on Costa Rica's Central Pacific coast, serves as the bustling gateway to the world-renowned Manuel Antonio National Park. Once a significant banana port, it has gracefully transitioned into a lively hub for ecotourism and sport fishing. The town itself offers a captivating blend of authentic local Tico culture and an accommodating international flair. Stroll along the scenic waterfront promenade, explore the vibrant local market (feria) on weekends for fresh produce, exotic spices, and artisan crafts, or relax at one of the many charming cafes and open-air restaurants.\n\nMarina Pez Vela, a modern world-class marina, stands as a key highlight, drawing sport fishing enthusiasts from across the globe and offering a variety of tours, from exhilarating catamaran cruises to serene dolphin watching expeditions. Beyond the marina, Quepos buzzes with a laid-back, infectious energy, making it an ideal base for exploring the region. While Manuel Antonio's stunning white-sand beaches, crystal-clear waters, and abundant wildlife (sloths, monkeys, iguanas) are just a short, inexpensive bus ride away, Quepos provides a more authentic and less overtly tourist-centric experience. Engage with friendly locals, sample incredible fresh seafood at a local soda (eatery), and immerse yourself in the lush natural beauty surrounding this charming Costa Rican gem. The town is highly walkable, with most amenities, including banks, pharmacies, and souvenir shops, conveniently close at hand. Don't miss a sunset over the Pacific from a waterfront restaurant. Embrace the Pura Vida lifestyle here, where adventure meets relaxation amidst a tropical paradise.",
